This is a new situation that has emerged for the first time since the formation of the modern system of international relations in 1648, and it is also the general trend of the current era. In line with the trend of history, China and Russia have shouldered the mission of the times and the mission of development, and have constructed an all-round new type of great-power relations characterised by multi-level and wide-ranging features on the basis of equality and mutual trust, with practical cooperation as the content, and with the goal of realising the \"Chinese dream\" and the \"Russian dream\", which is a new type of great-power relations in the present day."}

After World War II the decolonializing and modernizing Asia chose between two versions of European model of modernization and development. Each of them went through turbulent transformation at the second part of 20th Century and the mainstream model of development within the old technological stage was exhausted. Successful Non-Western countries based their way of development on the Western model of market economy but with national characteristics and put forward their own models of modernization managing to economically\"catch up\"leaders. Some even challenged the Western mode of post-industrial development. Thus the modern global model of high competition in modernization and development was created. This model requires education and training a new generation of professionals through\"responsible internationalization\"of future political elite. The creation of BRICS bloc is a new stage of the implementation of this cultural-educational strategy."}

The world order since the 1990s to the present is still a unipolar structure dominated by the United States, while existing international organizations and institutions are unable to prevent and resolve crises or conflicts. The NATO’s eastward expansion eventually led to Russia’s special military action against Ukraine. The United States and other Western countries have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia, which further promoted Russia’s “pivot to the East” in its foreign policy. Against the backdrop of accelerated evolution of great changes unseen in a century, the relative weakening of Western countries has made themselves unable to do what they want in the unipolar structure dominated by the United States. The rise of Global South has accelerated, and international structures of power have become more balanced. The outbreak and lasting of Russia-Ukraine conflict is leading the world move faster towards multipolarity, and the multipolar world is gradually returning. Facing such complex and severe challenges, appropriate national policy responses should be made. The two sides, based on principles of non-alliance, non-confrontation, and non-targeting of any third party, have found a path of major-country relations featuring strategic trust, good neighborliness and cooperation, setting a new model for international relations between major countries of different histories, cultures, political and economic systems.

Even if these two countries will reach a compromise on economic and trade issues due to domestic and international political factors, China will not give up its ambitions to gain world science and technology leadership, nor will the United States abandon its strategic intention to curb China’s momentum for development. Russia should continue to maintain economic and military cooperation with China, avoiding the deterioration of relations with the United States and the West, promoting the \"Greater Eurasian Partnership\" initiative in the Asia-Pacific region.

There exist endogenous confrontation and conflicts between revolutionary ideology and existing international order. As the guiding ideology of a country’s foreign policy,the revolutionary one has its inherent revisionist motives. The former is satisfied with the status quo, recognizing existing international distribution of power,complying with existing international law; while the latter is dissatisfied with the state quo, hoping to subvert and revise the existing power structure, criticizing current international law according to legal principles and is signed with the external expansion of imperialism. Traditionally, Russia’s ideology belongs to the former type, aiming at maintaining legitimacy and imperial tradition of absolute monarchy, turning against liberalism and nationalism. In the late 19 th century and early 20 th century, Pan-Slavism and international communism became dominant with distinct revolutionary features. Influenced by revolutionary ideology, the goal of Russia’s foreign policy was characterized by more revisionism, holding negative and hostile attitudes toward the traditional international system. Moreover, it underwent a series of confrontation and conflicts with then international system as well. However, compared with major powers, Russia did not have obvious advantages or disadvantages. As a result,out of the urgent need for national security, Russia needed to maintain the balance of power at that time in order to protect itself from being threatened and invaded by potential hegemons, especially those primary powers with invading intentions and obvious superiority in strength. In the last resort, in accordance with then prevailing international balance structure, Russia adjusted timely its foreign policies characterized by revolutionary ideology, making a certain degree of compromise in its revisionism goal.

China, Russia, the United States, European Union and other major international forces are exploring and preparing the relevant areas of guiding principles, main agendas, norms and institutions. The majority of the international community are strengthening multilateralism through cooperative combating against the pandemic. But the Trump administration is posing the most serious challenge to the multi-polarization and a more justified and rational world order by advocating America First and unilateralism. Therefore, analyzing and studying the changes in international configuration of powers and world order under the pandemic will help raise the consciousness of practices and theories so as to promote the building of a new type of international relations and community of shared future for mankind."}

China’s strategic thinking and holism could help make up for existing researches on the four-party relationship. Since the end of the Cold War, China-Russia-U.S.-Europe strategic relations have been generally stable, but they have also undergone dynamic adjustments due to changes both internally and externally. After Biden came into power, the four-party relationship is encountering new and important changes. The strategic interaction among these four parties is at a crossroads of history. The interaction of these four parties on development and setting agendas, maintaining international peace and security, in addition to seeking ideology of the times is of great and profound strategic significance. Neither China, Russia, the United States nor Europe alone could dominate current and future international relations and world affairs, but it is possible to achieve greater development and gain a more active position through their interaction. The international community should not only avoid the \"new cold war\" reactively, but also create actively a new environment for international cooperation and construct new types of international relations."}

Their materialistic and technological advantages over non-western world become unsustainable. It is just the time that we look back into the Bolshevik Revolution and have a much clearer perception of its historical significance. According to arguments of Lenin and Bolshevism on national self-determination and imperialism, the world war was directly related with the West-dominated imperialism and colonial system. At the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, when colonialism reached its peak, it challenged the West-dominated international order and ideology in all directions, pushing forward changes in international system. When constructing Western ideas, racism constitutes an important core of its ideology. As a matter of fact, those who advocate pluralism in Western countries do not want to see a truly pluralistic world. The West actually observes the world from a self-centered perspective and is unwilling to accept the rise of non-Christian and non-white nations. How to maintain the coexistence of civilizations will be a major challenge for the international system in the new era."}

As a result, we could observe the unique identity of Russia’s diplomacy. In terms of the structure, this article tries to explain the growth and development of Russia amid the world civilization and within the international system, including both internal and external characteristics of its civilization structure, in addition to its position and dynamic structural functions amid the multilateral relations among major countries. From the cyclical perspective, the article traces the recurring logic of Russia’s foreign relationship through the \"short-mediumlong durée\" analysis. In the context of global transformation and Russia’s interaction with other countries in particular, Russia’s diplomacy is explored.

In this report, centering on the theme of “promoting world peace, development and making endeavors to build a community with a shared future for mankind”, a series of new theories, new expressions, and new initiatives were put forward, which enriched and developed Xi Jinping’s diplomatic thoughts. The current international situation is undergoing profound changes, and the development and security of the international community are facing serious imbalance risks. The report put forward new judgments of “three changes” and “four major deficits”, and profoundly analyzed the new situation of the development of the world today and new challenges when building a community with a shared future for mankind.Regarding the resolution of the “four major deficits”, peace is the premise,development is the key, security is the guarantee, and governance is the path.China is committed to promoting coordination and positive interaction among major countries, promoting the resolution of hotspot issues, and consolidating the value foundation of international security.

Based on historical logic, real challenges and future development of Sino-Russian relations, this statement clarifies goals and directions for sustained and rapid development for Sino-Russian relations in leading the trend. The editorial board of Journal for Russian Studies specially organized these articles to discuss in-depth historical logic, ways of getting along,endogenous motivation and world significance of Sino-Russian relations. Thanks to the summarization of historical experience and lessons by heads of both countries, Sino-Russian relationship has entered a stage of comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era. Based on principles of “good neighborliness and friendship”, “equality and mutual benefit”, and “strategic coordination”, both countries have found ways such as “equality and mutual trust”,“non-alignment, non-confrontation, and no targeting of third parties”, “seeking common ground while shelving differences, and win-win cooperation” among major countries. It provides a demonstration of a new type of major-country relationship. The Sino-Russian relationship is a major-country relationship with endogenous motivation, guided by high-level exchanges. It ensures stability and long-term progress through political mutual trust, boosts cooperation and development through economic complementarity, and deepens social foundation of traditional friendship through cultural exchanges. Currently global major changes unseen in a century are accelerating, and the world has entered a new period of turmoil and changes. The impact of Sino-Russia relations goes beyond bilateral scope and is crucial to the world structure and future of mankind as well.China and Russia are global powers and neighbors. These two countries’ goodneighborliness and friendship, steady progress, and continuous deepening of strategic cooperation are in themselves conducive to the stability of international situation, to the multi-polarization of the world and democratization of international relations. Sino-Russian relations have global significance in terms of safeguarding international fairness and justice in politics, breaking shackles of the Cold War mentality in terms of security, building a new pattern of regional development economically, providing momentum for multilateralism in governance, and enriching the connotation of the new type of major country relationship theoretically."}

Within Russia, there are four views on the world today and the new world order, of which the \"multipolar world\" theory and the \"American unipolar world\" theory have had the greatest impact on Russian diplomacy. Since independence, Russia's foreign policy choices in terms of how to integrate into the Western-dominated international system have been contested in three orientations, which in fact constitute three stages in the evolution of Russia's foreign policy. The pragmatism of Putin's diplomacy, i.e., \"using the opponent's power for my own use\", is associated with Putin's view of national interests and is also an inevitable product of the process of Russia's transformation from a modern state to a post-modern state, which determines its duality and contradictory nature. The expectations of the concept of a \"multipolar world\" are manifold, but the multipolar diplomacy of the Yeltsin period was more confrontational and counterbalancing in terms of subjective motives as well as objective reactions, and after Putin's coming to power he began to turn it towards rationality and pragmatism, with greater emphasis on coordination among the major Powers and multilateral cooperation."}

After the end of the Cold War, the international environment in which Russian-Chinese bilateral relations were based changed considerably, economic development became the main theme of international relations, and ideology dominated the development of international relations."}

This article emphasizes that President Obama’s \"restart\" strategy involves almost no important strategic interests which are of great significance to Russia. The main interests of Russia and the United States are not in the bilateral relations, but in the relations with the third countries. This paper argues that Russia and the United States can’t implement their own interests without constructive cooperation. Therefore, Russia recommends that the U.S. should not \"reset\", but re-adjust the US-Russia relations and do a \"big deal\" with Russia on the basis of their fundamental interests and priorities."}

The China-Russia-India strategic triangle is a historical opportunity and a product of the times shouldering a major historical mission. It is not directed against any third party, but a constructive and open dialogue. The real siginificance of the strategic triangle is to set up a really just and rational international new order to settle the problems facing mankind in the 21st century. On the other hand, in the development of US-Indian relations, the US effort to make a cat’s paw of India to contain China and to interfere in the China-India-Russia strategic triangle is also futile. The United States and India differ not only in state interests, but also in cultural foundations, in the outlook of values and game rules. They have different ultimate goals with each taking its own needs and each having its axe to grind, while the China-Russia-India, with the expansion of their economic interests, will not only be interdependent, but also complementarian to each other, with more co-operation than competition. This will not only help promote their economic development and comprehensive national strength, but will also stand out as a highlight of the strategic triangle. Meanwhile they have greater co-operation potentials in the non-traditional security field. It is true that they are still confronted with new challenges and are required to properly deal with the existing contradictions and problems. For example, they have to settle their triangular contradictions and problems with the win-win idea, further strengthen triangular mechanism of mutual trust, security and co-operation and keep expanding the convergence of their interests. Only in this way can they expect to place their strategic partnership on the healthy track of benevolent interactions."}

Putin came to power and inherit ed his concept, yet displaying many different features from it in concrete diplo matic moves. As an important ideological concept, the idea of multi-polar world  sparked extensive controversies in Russia, which climaxed in 1998～2000. After t he outbreak of the Iraqi war, the future world order became the focus of discuss ions and Russia began to re-examine the concept and its diplomacy. This article  systematically expounds the formation of the concept, its connotation and specia l features. It makes a comparative analysis of the difference between Putin and  Primakov in the concept and points to the theoretical discrepancy of the concept , revealing its essence as well as its impact on Russian diplomacy.  The author  holds that the Russian multi-polar world concept is purported to build a balance  structure or strategic balance that tips in favor of itself, seeking for the id entity to participate in the game rules on a equal footing in a bid to achieve t he goal of restoring its great power status.

Based on the status signal theory, this article explores the reasons for Russia’ s “ struggle” strategy towards Ukraine, and tries toreveal the mechanism and deep reasons of Russia’ s demand for international and regional status. Russia’s special military operation against Ukraine faces multiple audiences, and international and domestic audiences have prompted it to shift towards a“struggle” strategy in pursuit of great power status. At the international level, the Hobbesian relationship model between hegemonic and rising powers is a structural prerequisite for the outbreak of conflicts. When a dependent country moves towards its own hostile camp, leading to a challenge to its international status, it adopts a“struggle” strategy, releasing a high-profile status signal. At the domestic level,facing the domestic audience group that has suffered losses due to war, they will use the image of “victims” to carry out “biased narratives”, releasing low-profile status signals to the audience group, stimulating domestic hawks, and ultimately promoting the adoption of“struggle” strategies externally. This research framework and related conclusions have certain implications for understanding the conflicts in the Post-Soviet region."}

Since the outbreak of the Iraqi War, many main force centers on the Asian-European continent have made strategic coordination. In recent years with the Asia and Europe dialogue deepening, mutual understanding is increased. The main causes for the trans-regional Asian European co-operation include the following: （1） Pushed by the trend of economic globalization, Asian-European economic and political exchanges and co-operation are rapidly developing and promoting the formation of Asian-European new partnership ties, and promoting the regional peace and development; （2） The center of world affairs is moving from the Atlantic region to the Pacific region; （3） Asian countries share many similar or close concepts with Russia in international affairs. The trend of Asian-European co-operative development has become one of the important manifestations of the world trend of polarization, helping accelerate the world’s polarization trend, but the process will still remain a protracted and complicated one.

However, a large number of important works show that the study of foreign policy in Russia remains essentially at the theoretical level. These experts have so little interest in policy formulation that politicians and civil servants continue to work without the support of independent analytical centres. Russia lacks independent think tanks in the process of foreign policy development, while \"think tanks\" have already become a mainstream instrument of Western political life. At the same time, Russia's attempts to establish think tanks and research centres have mostly failed, or their activities and influence have been very limited. The study found that the main obstacles to the development of independent foreign policy think tanks in Russia are the absence of a competitive environment for ideas, the lack of clear forms of cooperation between the government and think tanks, and the failure to diversify the planning and funding of think tanks.

Russia also used this favorable opportunity to make economic preparations for seizing the rights of the railway, i.e. giving credit to the government of the Qing Dynasty and establishing a Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank, attempting to control China’s economic lifeline. Russia signed the Sino-Russian Secret Agreement with the Qing government next year, obtaining a privilege of the Chinese Eastern Railway.

Concerning international turbulence, one of the most important indicators is the deglobalization of the world economy. The study on technological, social, economic, and political variables of social changes has revealed that the traditional social contract between government, business, and civil society within developed countries has come to a crisis. This social contract has been in effect for more than half a century, since the times of an industrial and bipolar world before globalization. Its inconsistency with modern realities, coupled with the inability of the old political center to offer convincing approaches to its modernization, has polarized societies and weakened social cohesion in the developed part of the world. As a result, populism and isolationism have come to power, which have started the dismantling of the existing system of global governance and its norms. For the current world order, the main challenge is an attempt to change the polycentric world to a uni-polar system with the dominance of the US. The most likely scenario for resolving this contradiction is to create a new bipolarity.

Moreover, in the historical scenario emphasizing timeliness, the strategic culture of diplomacy endows Russia with the transcendental combination of geographical space and elite consensus, and Russian uniqueness always appears in different forms and conceptual systems at the appropriate time, which is the reflection of Russian national temperament in presidential personality.

According to the author, the use of new concepts may mean a change in the theoretical framework of Russian foreign policy. The author's main points are that the theory of civilisation has historical depth, helps to understand the cultural factors behind foreign policy, and is a way of thinking beyond the nation-state paradigm, but the theory of civilisation also has shortcomings. Firstly, realpolitik still needs to be understood in the context of reality; secondly, civilizational theory is not universally interpretative of the issues of peace and war; and thirdly, it is difficult to integrate the concepts of sovereignty and civilisation when the nation-state model is still the dominant model for actors in international relations. Russia may be trying to break away from its almost century-and-a-half-long track of national identity under the influence of Western thought and seek a new identity through the concept of \"nation-civilisation\", but this path is bound to be a difficult one, and the applicability of the \"nation-civilisation\" model to other countries is uncertain.

But whether the founder can always be the main beneficiary of the new institution is questionable. Russia pushed for the creation of United Nations Open-Ended Working Group（OEWG） to undertake the mission of norm-making for cyber security issues. However, the influence that Russia gained during the operation of the institution cannot compete with what the United States and its allies acquired.Through “open-ended institution” that has unlimited quota for participants, states under different conditions can acquire different types of influence. The main benefit for Russia to launch OEWG was being recognized by more states as the “leader” of an inclusive, open norm-making process, which led to the improvement of reputation. In order to maintain this benefit, Russia prioritized the task of making sure that the institution can complete its mission on schedule, rather than striving for more support for its norm proposals. This left the United States and its allies an opportunity to mobilize states and non-state actors to make their norm proposals more supported in practice.The two sides acquired different types of influence, which varied in significance for states to improve influence on norm-making. The research shows that combining the creation of new institution with mobilization of support for norm proposals is difficult but important."}

The social mentality of hostility and fear,as well as the economic expectations of jeopardized interests,exacerbated the uncertainty and insecurity of both sides of the conflict.

However,the rise of bipolarism in recent years has posed challenges against multipolarism,wherein,the two poles refer to China and the US,and their basic indicator is defined by the economic aggregate. Nevertheless,bipolarism has not yet gained unanimous consensus as China still has incomplete aggregative indicator. The co-existence of bipolarity and multipolarity in subjective cognition and objective reality marks a unique phenomenon of today’s international structure,and their relations can be defined by a bipolar structure in a multipolar framework,or a multipolar structure with two dominant poles. This is a mirror of the complexity and contradiction of the international structure in reality,and the status will be maintained in the long run with a trend of forming stronger bipolar structure features. As one of the poles,China should be guided by the general theory and concept of multilateralism instead of multipolarism. Decoupled from any specific international structure,multilateralism enables China to remain unaffected by changes in its own status,align its diplomatic theory with varied international structures,and contribute to hold the theoretical basis of Sino-Russian international cooperation."}

The impact of economic globalisation on the strategic cultures of the emerging Powers is manifested in the following ways: first, it has changed the strategic thinking mode of the emerging Powers, which used to attach importance to ideology; second, it has led the emerging Powers to form a new mode of win-win relations in terms of competition and co-operation with the existing Powers; and, third, it has changed the emerging Powers' perceptions of the international organisations, and has attached importance to making use of the platform of the existing international mechanisms in pursuit of their national interests."}

It is expected that by 2030, the freight volume through the Caspian Sea along the TITR will increase to three times its 2021 level, reaching 11 million tons. China’s participation in the construction of the TITR will contribute to high-quality Belt and Road Initiative cooperation, avoid geo-economic risks caused by geopolitical conflicts in the Eurasian continent to achieve the balanced and diversified development of the northern, central and southern lines of the China-Europe Railway Corridor. At the same time, the construction of the TITR also faces challenges such as cargo delays due to low transportation capacity, relatively backward infrastructure such as railways and ports, interruptions of cargo transportation due to climate change in the Caspian Sea, and differences in attitudes of stakeholders. China and the countries along the corridor can promote the construction of the TITR by improving the efficiency of multimodal transportation along the TITR, strengthening the electrification of railways and the construction of port transportation capacity along the TITR, jointly addressing impacts of climate change in the Caspian Sea, and stimulating the economic and social development of the regions along the TITR."}

Since the 21st century,a series of factors such as the transformation and upgrading of U.

The debate has centered on how Germany and Europe can be secured assuming the loss of the U. S. nuclear umbrella.This comprehensive,public,and ongoing debate and media coverage is particularly rare in Germany,where the debate itself caused a “political earthquake”. Multiple“nuclear options”are under discussion: pan-European deterrence or European deterrence,indigenous German nuclear deterrence and maintaining Germany’s nuclear potential. The debate is an important attempt by Germany to play a more active role in building European security and defense,to break the nuclear taboo,and to “test the waters”for nuclear ownership.

More importantly, it intends to use critical minerals as a new strategic tool for a long-term confrontation with the West and effectively ensure its national security and development interests. Towards this end, Russia has formulated strategic plans, encouraged import substitution, increased policy support,promoted geological study and exploration, and accelerated Arctic development. However, Russia faces many constraints in critical mineral development.

This has led to rising global prices and inflation, financial tightening, increased pressure on the international financial environment, heightened volatility in international financial markets, and increased fragility in the international banking sector, thereby elevating the risks to international financial stability. Moreover, the war has exerted substantial political pressure on the international financial system, accelerating the politicization of international finance, escalating financial warfare, highlighting the weaponization of finance by major powers, and inducing the fragmentation of international finance, all of which exacerbate the challenges to international financial governance. In this new context, China should accelerate the internationalization of the Renminbi; uphold financial globalization and promote high-level market openness; strengthen international financial governance cooperation and expand the provision of public goods; and enhance financial regulation to mitigate risks associated with financial fragility."}

With the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the Western developed countries have increasingly relied on their advantages in cyber power to launch economic sanctions against Russia. There are many similarities and differences. I started to expand and reflect on my previous article. That article analysed the use of cyber power by the hegemonic powers against the rising powers and drew a logical map of the hegemonic powers' implementation of cyber power. However, in the case of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the economic sanctions were directed against Russia, another important country in the system other than the rising countries, whose characteristic is that its domestic economy is not deeply embedded in economic globalisation, but it has an important impact on the system. The use of cyber power by the hegemonic powers in a context of less intense interdependence, coupled with the fact that the sanctions were not targeted at the rising powers, inevitably led to a different mode of operation, specific objectives and impact of the weaponisation of interdependence. Based on this new case, I would like to revise the framework of the previous study to further expand the scope, refine the target and enhance the explanatory power."}

Later, he served as First Deputy Minister of the USSR's Atomic Energy Industry, Deputy Minister of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry, and Director of the Russian Scientific Centre. In particular, after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, Sidorenko was in charge of the investigation of the causes of the accident. In this paper, Sidorenko, as a first-hand witness of the atomic energy management in the USSR, analyses the trajectory of the development and evolution of the atomic energy management institutions in the USSR (and later in Russia), pointing out that the management of nuclear power plants is a crossroads between the electric power system and the atomic energy system, and that the different styles of action of the relevant management institutions and the tensions between them are one of the most important factors contributing to the high number of accidents, and the major accidents that occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant made the originally decentralised atomic energy system in the USSR more difficult to deal with. The major accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant led to the centralisation of the Soviet Union's previously decentralised atomic energy authority and an increased emphasis on the safety of nuclear power plant operations. The dissolution of the USSR led to the transformation of the Russian atomic energy industry and the management of atomic energy into market relations. This new environment has also created new requirements and challenges for the management of atomic energy in Russia."}

On this basis, the United States put forward the so-called \"Greater Middle East Programme\". On the one hand, the United States rebuilt the regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq on the basis of the Western democratic system. On the other hand, the United States is exporting democracy to other countries in the Middle East and even to pro-American countries. The strategic intention of the U.S. is to transform the Middle East through democracy in order to eliminate the soil of terrorism and extremism, subvert the anti-American countries in the Middle East, resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and thus build a new order in the Middle East region as well as a pro-American political atmosphere.

With the development of its naval power, the Soviet Union shifted its maritime strategy from coastal defence to oceanic attack, and constantly sought a military presence in the strategic area of the South China Sea, which was mainly manifested in its acquisition and strategic operation of Cam Ranh Bay in Viet Nam. At the same time, the Soviet Union's Pacific Fleet has become increasingly active in the South China Sea, competing with the United States naval forces. Due to the lack of economic impetus and the counteraction of the United States, China and Southeast Asian countries, the Soviet Union's military presence in the South China Sea was constantly limited, and eventually withdrew from the region as the Soviet Union declined. However, the maritime traditions formed during the Soviet era have been inherited by present-day Russia, as evidenced by its increased presence in the South China Sea in recent years."}

Russia’s assertive diplomatic and security policies can be observed through its hard-line strategic posture towards the US and NATO, and its pursuit of diplomatic and security objectives beyond its national strength. Although a mutual shaping relationship between the evolution of Russia’s strategic perception and its colliding interests with the United States can be seen clearly in Russia-US interactions, changes in Russia’s strategic perception are not merely determined by national interest considerations. Historical and psychological factors that shape Russia’s strategic perception play a very important role in making people understand why Russia has placed a high premium on NATO’s eastward expansion, the situation in Ukraine and its actions in Syria with a massive investment of resources. Many policies and actions adopted by the United States do not pay any attention to these historical and psychological factors, which is deemed as \"insulting\" or \"threatening\" by Russia, thus giving rise to a spiral of enmity and antagonism between the two sides. Due to Russia’s unique historical memory and great-power complex, Russia has made drastic responses to the conflicts of interests with the United States. Although these responses are not conducive to Russia’s national strength and overall national interests, they may still be justified. Now that Russia’s strategic perception of the US is beginning to take shape, it is quite difficult to \"restart\" the Russia-US relations in the short term. Viewed from the case study of Russia’s strategic perception of the US, strategic perception in itself has its relative independence, which is not only affected by conflicts of interests but also influenced by social and cultural factors so that a country’s foreign policies may not always follow the path of rationalism."}

However, unlike the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other countries, the threat of terrorism in Russia comes mainly from within its borders, which makes it more difficult to prevent and identify terrorist activities in Russia. The serious terrorist situation determines to a large extent the cruelty, longevity and complexity of Russia's counter-terrorism struggle, and also determines that Russia's counter-terrorism management mechanism will continue to be in the process of continuous development and adjustment."}

The obstacles posed by the international system to Russia are the focus of its foreign policy breakthroughs, and understanding the overall transformation of Russian society is a fundamental factor in measuring the direction of foreign policy. The essence of the transformation of Russia's foreign policy lies in the enhancement of Russia's position in the world economic landscape and its attempts to create a new international economic system in which it will have a say, to become a new rule-setter and to provide a favourable international economic environment for the preferences of domestic actors."}

Through military actions, Russia successfully prevented the spread of terrorist activities, enhanced its international influence and gained a strategic advantage in the Middle East. At present, conflicts among different groups remain complex and multi lateral forces continue their in-depth game playing. Russia announced the withdrawal of troops from Syria twice and demonstrated its \"smart power\" in a military and diplomatic linkage mechanism. Thanks to its ingenious maneuvers, Russia was able to gain strategic dividends and attain part of its defined geopolitical goals. However, Russia’s prolonged involvement in Syria’s geopolitical competition with the United States and the West has undoubtedly become a heavy burden on the country’s rejuvenation. The lasting unrest in Syria and in-depth intervention of external major powers made it impossible for Russia to completely withdraw from Syria. Scrambling for the dominance and international discourse power centered on Syria and the Middle East will be repeatedly staged among major powers. As Putin is at the helm of the state in his fourth term of presidency, Russia will still face severe challenges in addressing the Syrian crisis, breaking down Western sanctions and revitalizing its national economy. Therefore, Putin and the elites of Russia are supposed to explore and come up with \"new ideas\" to tackle these problems."}

On the one hand, through the setbacks suffered by the Russian civilisation in the process of striving for the development of westernisation and the discrimination and containment mentality of the West towards the Russian civilisation, it is possible to see that the West has unfriendly or even hostile attitudes towards the Russian civilisation, and this ideological conflict brought about by civilisational differences has to a large extent aggravated the formation of the Cold War situation. On the other hand, the \"salvationism\" of the Christian Orthodox cultural background gave rise to the \"sense of mission\" of the Russian nation, while the \"sense of mission\" of Protestant Christians and the \"model of the world\" concept of the United States gave rise to the \"sense of mission\" of the United States.

Armaments cooperation between India and Russia has reached a stage of heavy dependency that does not arise naturally but is created and reinforced by Russia’s adoption of proactive lock-in tactics as a resource supplier. Through a series of proactive tactics featuring “demonstration-supply-stimulation-binding,” Russia has succeeded in reinforcing India’s heavy dependency on its arms supply, which prompts India’s defense development model and military doctrines to be deeply branded with a strong Russian imprint. The strengthened arms dependency has, on the one hand, proactively consolidated India-Russia relations and, on the other hand, undermined India’s strategic flexibility by dragging India into the risk of opportunism. At present, intensified competition in the international arms export market, arms trade friction between India and Russia, and the development of US-India military relations are playing a more important role in impacting the stability of India-Russia armament dependency."}

Since the beginning of the 21 st century, the changes in the international situation and positiveefforts made by the two countries have created a favorable diplomatic environment for China and Russia to further their maritime security cooperation. The multi-level and multi-field cooperation mechanism has provided an effective exchange and communication platform for maritime security cooperation between China and Russia.

China’s \"Belt and Road\" initiative and Russia’s \"looking east\" policy are constantly expanding the common interests of both sides in terms of maritime security. However, the current maritime security cooperation between China and Russia also faces such issues as insufficient trust, different maritime defense focuses as well as the complex and sensitive marine environment in the global context.

In August 2019, the United States and Russia withdrew from the INF Treaty one after another, arousing great concerns from the international community. The misgivings are that their withdrawal from the treaty will affect global strategic stability and security situations in Europe and Asia, trigger a new round of arms race and undermine the international arms control system. China has been taken by the United States as an important excuse for its withdrawal, so the demise of the treaty is bound to exert a profound impact on China’s external security environment. This paper intends to review the creation, development and termination of the INF Treaty, analyze its evolutionary causes on the international, domestic and personal levels and concludes that changes in the international landscape have played a decisive role in making the treaty rise and fall. In the 1980s, changes in the balance of power between the Soviet Union and the United States led to the birth of the INF Treaty. In the 21st centurary, pressures from NATO and the proliferation of missile technology prompted Russia to launch the initiative to globalize the INF Treaty. In recent years, the relative decline of the US hegemonic position has created the environment for the US to opt out of the INF Treaty. At the same time, domestic politics and leadership changes in the United States and Russia have also exerted profound influence on the timing and mode of the \"creation, evolution and demise\" of the treaty. Mikhail Gorbachev’s \"new thinking\" reforms and the upsurge in nuclear disarmament movement in the 1980s provided a special political and social context for the birth of the INF Treaty. The \"America First\" concept pursued by the Donald Trump administration has prompted the United States to withdraw from various international treaties and organizations, making the INF Treaty one of the victims. In different historical periods, the role of the INF varied in maintaining global strategic stability. In the early 1960s, it was the backbone of the central deterrence of the United States and the Soviet Union. In the 1970s and 1980s, INF became an important factor affecting extended deterrence. In the 21st century, it has become a tool for Russia to fight against the US missile defense system. At present, INF plays an increasingly important role in cross-domain deterrence. The world is now witnessing a recurrence of the INF competition among big powers, but the new round of competition will surely demonstrate many new characteristics different from those of the past."}

They hold great geopolitical significance for China’s \"Belt and Road\" initiative that connects China with Europe through Central Asia. Since 1991, great powers have been striving to win over these countries due to their unique strategic position. Under the framework of the \"Belt and Road\" initiative, China has established close cooperation with them. The three Transcaucasian countries have taken a positive attitude toward the initiative and deemed it as a golden opportunity for their economic development. The political and academic circles as well as the media have been particularly cooperative in promoting the initiative. In this favorable context, many cooperation projects between China and relevant countries have been well under way and China’s influence over the Caucasus region has been further strengthened. However, China may also need to deal with, at different levels, the varied nature and complexity of a range of domestic issues of relevant countries. This paper intends to discuss the possible risks in the future cooperation between China and the Transcaucasian countries under the framework of the \"Belt and Road\" initiative from four aspects: the domestic socio-political issues in the three countries, the complex and fragile trilateral relations, the exogenous terrorism of relevant countries and the impending geopolitical changes that the Caucasus region may face. Today, the great power contest in a certain region could also spill over to other regions and even cause resonance across the globe. Given that China has enormous vested geopolitical, geo-economic and geo-cultural interests in the Caucasus region, these security risks must be evaluated carefully and addressed properly."}

It is difficult to evaluate the acute and growing threat posed by Foreign Terrorist Fighters comprehensively if they are just viewed as separate fighters. The study should be conducted on the following three levels: the global strategic layout of the \"Islamic State\", the development and restructuring of indigenous terrorist organizations in accordance with local issues and actual situations, and the linkage of the nets of Foreign Terrorist Fighters’activities. On these three levels, Russia and Central Asiaare facing increasingly grave security risks. First of all, both Russia and Central Asia have a tremendous scale of Foreign Terrorist Fighters, most of whom have been the main force of the \" Islamic State \" and its branches and have repeatedly launched terrorist attacks in various parts of the world. Second, Foreign Terrorist Fighters in both Russia and Central Asia are highly organized. The allegiance organizations and branches of the \" Islamic State\", especially the \" Khorasan\", will become important carriers for the flowing and returning Foreign Terrorist Fighters. Third, the flowing and returning Foreign Terrorist Fighters will not only accelerate the infiltration of violent extremism such as the Jihadi-Salafism but also enhance the internationalization of the local terrorism in Russia and Central Asia.

The main driving forces behind this policy are that the United States believes that Russia is actively pursuing world power status, China’s economic and military power is growing rapidly, other emerging powers are rising collectively, world politics is returning to great-power geopolitical competition and the US global hegemony is faced with severe challenges. After the end of the Cold War, nuclear forces have been regarded as a cornerstone for Russia’s world power status. Russia makes every effort to promote its development and deployment of strategic nuclear weapons and tries to rebuild its tactical nuclear forces. At the same time, China’s nuclear weapons modernization has made considerable headway. North Korea and Iran have also made great progress in building their nuclear arsenal. These developments have aroused a lot of conjecture and surmise on the part of the United States. The US strategic nuclear forces have become less important in the US national security strategy as a result of such military doctrines as precision strike deterrence. Insufficient long-term investment and aging nuclear arsenal have also damaged the combat effectiveness of the US nuclear forces. Since the odds have been small that a nuclear war would break out after the Cold War, the US nuclear forces have slacked off in their combat readiness and been caught up in mismanagement. Although the Trump administration’s reshaping of the US nuclear armament can enhance the predominant position of the US strategic nuclear forces, it may also weaken the competitive edge of the US conventional military forces with the possibility that marginal gains are smaller than marginal costs. The US reshaping of its nuclear armament will inevitably trigger another round of nuclear arms race and endanger global strategic stability."}

This article first compares the views of both China and Russia on international politico-security order in their foreign policy documents, and then moves to the empirical side, that is, deciphering their views on international politico-security order through their voting choices in the UN Security Council. The combination of text analysis and action observation may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the views of the two countries. By no means shall China and Russia be viewed as \"revisionist countries\" as both of them advocate maintaining the stability of the UN-centered international politico-security order, promoting the development of a multi-polarized order in a more fair and reasonable direction, safeguarding international fairness and justice, opposing arms races and the militarization of outer space, as well as fighting against hegemonism and power politics. At the same time, it should be noted that the two countries differ in their understandings of multi-polarization, means to maintain international political security, the Eurasian regional order and non-traditional security.

Existing studies have mainly analyzed the behavioral logic of third-party states from the perspectives of international institutions, public choices and alliance politics, ignoring their different integration levels into the international economic system, which constrains their policy autonomy in sanctions disputes. Based on the theory of economic sanctions busting, this paper further points out that when sanctions busting yields high strategic benefits, third-party states’ integration level into the existing international economic system shapes their strategic choices of sanctionsbusting activities. The 2022 US-Russia sanctions dispute is a case in point. On Iran’s part, the strategic benefits of busting US sanctions against Russia are relatively high, and its integration into the existing international economic system is relatively low, which prompts Iran to adopt a direct sanctions-busting strategy by providing military assistance to Russia, regardless of the secondary sanctions threat from the Western countries. As for India, helping Russia bust US sanctions is strategically profitable, but India’s high-level integration into the existing international economic system has made it adopt indirect trade-based sanctions busting."}

National security includes both material security on the realistic dimension and identity security on the conceptual dimension. The core connotation of national identity security is the certainty of identity forged by the combination of external recognition and internal stability of national identity. Only by simultaneously obtaining ontological security and recognition security can the State ensure its identity security. Recognition security is a sense of satisfaction that derives from the recognition by others of the self-understanding held by an actor about its essential attributes. This sense of satisfaction has two sources: the fulfillment of the actor’s basic needs for recognition, and the smooth generation and development of the actor’s identity. More specifically, the foundation for the establishment of recognition security is the self-affirmation brought about by the consistency between the actor’s self-understanding and the other’s understanding of the actor. This self-affirmation is a positive result of the actor’s action of satisfying its recognition needs and realizing its identity generation, thus constituting a direct source of the actor’s sense of satisfaction, which ensures its sense of security in terms of recognition. On the contrary, the source of recognition insecurity is the self-doubt brought about by the inconsistency between the actor’s self-understanding and the other’s understanding of the actor. This self-doubt is a negative result of the actor’s inability to meet its recognition needs and the unsuccessful identity generation, which blocks the formation of the actor’s sense of satisfaction and thus leads to the sense of insecurity in terms of recognition. Recognition insecurity will cause the State to experience anxiety characterized by excessive worrying, and resentment dominated by the impulse to retaliate, both of which will prompt the State to engage in destructive behaviors of high uncertainty. The recognition security problem and its international consequences in the processes of national identity construction by Russia and Turkey can provide preliminary empirical verification for the theoretical findings on recognition security."}

Correspondingly, counter-weaponization refers to the defensive strategies adopted by the target state to evade or mitigate such harm. Based on the sources of the initiating state’s power, WI can be categorized into three types: the one featured by the supply-based power that is rooted in the initiator’s control over natural resources or high-tech products, the one featured by the chokepoint-based power that is derived from the dominance of the initiator over strategic channels and critical infrastructure, and the one featured by the market-based power that is anchored in the initiator’s large domestic market and consumption capacity. As a strategic interaction between the target state and the initiator, the counter-weaponization process highlights tailored strategies. To counter supply-based WI, the target state must enhance its supply chain resilience through self-sufficiency or import diversification, reducing reliance on the initiator’s resources or technology. In response to chokepoint-based WI, the target state needs to diversify its transportation modes, optimize logistics and upgrade its infrastructure to decrease dependence on the initiator’s strategic channels. When facing market-based WI, the target state should actively explore new markets, sustain its international revenue streams, and mitigate reliance on the initiator’s market. Cases such as the ROK’s response to Japan’s export restrictions on semiconductor materials, Qatar’s coping measures during the diplomatic crisis, and Russia’s reaction to Western energy sanctions exemplify these counter-weaponization strategies."}

In recent years, in the context of accelerated changes in the Arctic environment, the strengthened capabilities of relevant countries in their polar activities as well as the increasingly fierce energy competition across the globe, there is a growing and pressing demand for countries to broaden and expand their energy access channels. Both the Arctic countries represented by Russia and the \"non-Arctic countries\" represented by China have made more and more energy rights claims and higher demands for maintaining energy security in the Arctic region. Centered on the demarcation of public and private attributes, the choices between inclusive and exclusive policies as well as the power-sharing standards, multiple rounds of contests have been comprehensively carried out in the Arctic region. At present, against the backdrop of \"consistent ideas coexisting with conflicting objectives\" relevant countries find it more difficult to work together in the Arctic region, especially in the field of energy development. As for China, advocate of the construction of the \"Ice Silk Road\", it should proactively engage with those countries with the most influence in the Arctic region by sharing ideas, coordinating agendas and promoting cooperation in order to play an actively role in Arctic affairs, better safeguard its energy security, avoid strategic losses caused by vicious competition and lay a solid foundation for raising China’s voice in the Arctic energy development."}

During the Cold War era,Europe was an important battlefield where the Soviet Union and the United States scrambled for world hegemony. A fanatic nuclear arms race was carried out the two countries and Europe was shrouded in dark clouds of nuclear fear for a long time. When the Cold War was over,European countries successfully stepped out from the nuclear haze. Dominated by the United States,NATO gradually reached its heyday. Based on an optimistic judgment over the international security situation in the post-Cold War era,NATO shifted its concern and focus from purely traditional military defense to a broader non-traditional security area,which weakened the importance of nuclear weapons in NATO’s defense strategies and led to a cut-down on nuclear forces. However,this situation didn’t last long. The Ukraine crisis in 2014 had a tremendous impact on the strategic pattern of Europe and the relationships between Russia and the United States/Europe had dropped to a point close to freezing.These two big powers began to exhibit their respective nuclear power,thus recasting a nuclear shadow over Europe. Reviewing the historical evolution of NATO in its nuclear situation and examining the impact of Ukraine crisis on NATO’s nuclear posture,people can get a glimpse of its future security trend. The current changes in NATO and Russia’s nuclear postures suggest that the competition mode and nuclear risk in the future will differ from those in the Cold War era,which gives rise to a lower nuclear threshold and an increased possibility of the use of nuclear weapons. These changes will exert a profound impact on the global nuclear non-proliferation mechanism,the nuclear disarmament process and the model of military rivalry."}

The main features of the international situation over the past year are: the trend towards multipolarity has seen new developments in the political and economic spheres at the global or regional level; there have been new divisions and combinations of forces in the world; and various regional and intercontinental cooperation organisations have been more active than ever before. At the same time, however, the hegemony and power politics of the United States, currently the sole super-Power, have become very aggressive; the security situation in the world is favourable, with local wars and regional conflicts generally cooling down and the tendency towards peace talks and reconciliation increasing. However, there is instability in stability, some regions are still at war, and some countries are in chaos again, so the world is not at peace; the world economy is generally growing, but the development of the North and South is unbalanced, and there are all kinds of intricate contradictions and struggles; our country's situation is very good, and its international status has risen, which has made it an important factor in the promotion of peace, stability and development of the world; however, the plans to curb China are still going on one after the other. Looking ahead to 1998, the international situation will continue to develop in a favourable direction on the basis of 1997; some of the world's hot spots may be further cooled down through negotiation and political settlement; the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in the Middle East may make some progress; and the Asia-Pacific region will continue to maintain the situation of development and stability."}

Both Britain and Russia were the largest colonial sovereigns in this history, and their colonial expansion has profoundly influenced the geopolitical pattern of the world today. The geopolitical contrasts are an important reason for the differences between the British and Russian colonial systems of governance. On the one hand, Britain's colonialist system of administration brought deep disasters to civilisations outside the West, and on the other hand, objectively brought the advanced political system and advanced civilisation of capitalism to the whole world; on the other hand, Russia's colonialist system of administration brought to its Eastern colonies the overwhelmingly negative impact of the Russian-style authoritarian system."}

The European Union and the United States are the biggest senders of sanctions, and their collaboration on sanctions has been influential in many regions and areas. Despite the high frequency of collaboration on technology sanctions, many divergences arise between the EU and the US in terms of sanction policies. Starting from such dimensions as common values, security threats, and secondary sanctions, this paper aims to establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the motivating factors that facilitate collaboration and the contributing factors that induce divergences in the EU and US technology sanctions. It has selected three cases related to Russia, Iran and China for comparison. The findings are that the EU and the US have the highest level of collaboration on imposing sanctions against Russia. In the case of Iran, more prominent divergences related to secondary sanctions have appeared. As regards China, no clear consensus on technology sanctions has been reached yet. This paper argues that common values, urgency of security threats and pressure of secondary sanctions are important driving factors for the EU to collaborate with the US on technology sanctions. However, different foreign policy concepts, misalignment of security perceptions and the countervailing force of secondary sanctions also make it difficult to bridge the differences between the EU and the US, thus significantly reducing the efficiency of sanctions."}

Applying the “window of opportunity” framework to the explanation of this phenomenon,this paper argues that Turkey’s aggressive involvement in the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is inseparable from its awareness and grasp of the “window of opportunity.” The “window of opportunity” involves factors like emergence of “crisis events,” changes in the international situation and domestic political mobilization.The emergence of the crisis event of the Azerbaijan-Armenia border conflict was the catalyst for Turkey to initiate relevant actions after an overall consideration of domestic and international factors.The international factors considered by Turkey at that time included the implications of the game among major powers in the South Caucasus and the power contrast between Azerbaijan and Armenia.There were also domestic factors for the Turkish intervention:a series of changes in its political system and elite alliances,changes in mainstream cultural trends,and changes in its relations with the countries in conflict.These changes jointly prompted the Turkish government to launch internal political mobilization,which further gave legitimacy to the Turkish intervention in the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and facilitated the Turkish government’s actions to seize the opportunity.Analyzing the processes of Turkey’s waiting in the wings before and after the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict can not only rationalize its “reckless” intervention,but also provide a deeper understanding of the “aggressive” foreign policies implemented by the Turkish government in recent years."}

Central Asia is an indispensable geostrategic space for the future development of China and Russia, and competition between them and the possible negative impact of such competition are unavoidable, but this also creates an opportunity for broader and deeper cooperation between China and Russia. As a regional cooperation and security structure, the SCO balances the interests of the two major powers in the region, reflects the common needs of China and Russia to maintain security in Eurasia, and enables the Central Asian countries to explore ways to promote cooperation and security with the major powers in the region on an equal footing, thus building a good platform for coordinating Sino-Russian energy relations in Central Asia and strengthening cooperation."}

The existing research has largely overlooked the asymmetric form of territorial disputes and the behavioral logic behind the weaker state’s choices. Due to the power gap between the disputing parties, the asymmetric territorial disputes have an important impact on the weaker state’s behaviors and the interaction between the weaker State and its stronger counterpart. The weaker State policymakers’ evaluation of the punishment possibility and the victim mentality of its domestic society are the two key contributing factors that affect the weaker state’s escalation behaviors in asymmetric territorial disputes. The policymakers’ supposition that the escalation behaviors will not trigger severe punishment from the stronger State could lead them to be optimistic about the cost-benefit outcome of their choices, which contributes to the weaker state’s efforts to escalate territorial disputes. The victim mentality that the weaker State develops in its interactions with the stronger State prompts it to accept the potential risks of using force, which constitutes a strategic motivation for the weaker State to escalate territorial disputes. Two cases, the Argentine-British Malvinas War of 1982 and the Russia-Georgia Conflict of 2008, can provide empirical evidence for this analytical framework. The paper contributes to a theoretical understanding of the outbreak and escalation of asymmetrical territorial disputes, and at the same time provide practical insights into the recurrence of territorial disputes in China’s periphery."}

Analyses of economic and financial security cooperation among BRICS countries show that positive trade momentum has waned as a result of trade protectionism and the reversal in globalization. BRICS countries are facing the pressure of decreasing FDI net inflow owing to hiking interest rates by the US Federal Reserve,intervention policies of FDI,political unrest,economic weakening,etc. Energy security cooperation among BRICS countries is plagued by the sharp fluctuations of international bulk commodity prices. Financial security cooperation among BRICS countries moves forward slowly. Therefore,this paper argues that BRICS countries should keep deepening reforms in various fields and speeding up the adjustment of their economic structures so as to lay a solid foundation for security cooperation among BRICS countries. By means of linking development strategies of BRICS countries and promoting the level of security cooperation,the BRICS countries will strengthen their mutual communication and coordination,enrich the connotation of their security cooperation,and actively participate in global governance."}

When a state perceives that the benefits of economic cooperation may harm its overall gains from power competition, or when political and diplomatic relations between states experience significant shocks or disruptions, the logic of national security will override the logic of economics. In this circumstance, close economic and trade relations between states may not serve as a “ballast” that helps manage conflicts and disagreements but instead become a perceived “security threat”, thus providing certain states with excuses or means to limit or sever bilateral political and economic ties. The economic interdependence between states hence is reduced to a strategic tool for the securitizing state to maintain and expand its power, engage in geopolitical competition, weaken or manipulate other states. This paper aims to examine both Sino-American and RussiaEuropean relations that feature closer economic interdependence. By comparing different dynamics in economic securitization behind these relations, this paper analyzes the logic of choice behind the turn toward economic securitization and offers insights into how China can better respond to the challenges of economic securitization and more effectively utilize the “ballast effect” of economic relations."}

It is evident that the United States intends to exploit the agenda to achieve its own goals, namely interfering with its adversaries’ development of their asymmetric anti-satellite weapons, forging its space alliances, drawing “red lines” for space deterrence, and enhancing its argument about space debris. Now, the new agenda has produced significant influence on space security regimes in that it has not only given rise to political confrontations among major countries but also reflected the new trends in the development of international space regimes.

Since the end of the Cold War, there have been new developments in security studies that are diametrically different from the traditional security researches centered on national military security. In the 1990s, the constructivist theory of securitization was put forward by the Copenhagen School. Feminist security studies attach great importance to the relationship between gender and security, arguing that the securitization theory of the Copenhagen School fails to include a concept of gendered security and has no concept of gender-based insecurity. With the joint efforts of all stakeholders, the UN Security Council resolution 1325（2000） and its subsequent resolutions established the Women, Peace and Security Agenda（WPS Agenda）, and thus gender issues have been integrated into international peace and security agenda. Whether such gender issues as women’s participation, women’s rights and sexual violence are a matter of securitization or de-securitization is actually influenced by multiple intertwined factors. Under the comprehensive influences of different actors and various factors, the interactions and debates concerning the WPS Agenda among the members of the Security Council, especially its permanent members, have promoted the development process of securitization of gender issues, which not only demonstrates the complexity of “inter-subjective and socially constructed” securitization issues, but also regulates the degrees and limits of securitization under the Security Council’s voting mechanism.

Different degrees of structural constraints on political leaders and diverse strategic situations they are facing constitute important factors affecting their capabilities to shape national security strategies. Holding a negative perception of America’s national security environment, President Biden tends to identify the so-called revisionist countries that aim to change the “status quo” and global security issues as major sources of threat to the US national security. Therefore, the US strives to achieve its priority goals in the fields of security, ideology, and economy and trade by means of values diplomacy, post-emptive measures and multilateral cooperation.

Against the backdrop of deepened civil-military integration, intensified major-country competition as well as the militarization of outer space, the increasingly crowded outer space has not only posed serious risks to the operational safety of space activities, but also brought about great challenges to national space security, such as strategic miscalculation and conflict escalation. For this reason, it is a matter of practical urgency to establish a set of space traffic management mechanisms that cover both safety and security concerns. As the current concept of space traffic management lacks adequate consideration of national space security, it is necessary to grasp the reality of international space governance in terms of the registration of space objects, the transparency of space activities, the enhancement of space monitoring and tracking capabilities and the governance of space debris, further clarifying the following three major tasks of improving the space object registration system, ensuring the safety of space operations and coordinating national space security efforts in space traffic management. In order to efficiently and effectively address key space safety and security issues through space traffic management, the international community should improve the registration mechanism for constellations, make constellation information sharing policies, and build a two-fold safety and security mechanism to guarantee the long-term sustainable development of outer space activities and protect the space environment."}

The relatively weaker capacity in China’s nuclear deterrence has created the stability of an asymmetric deterrence which is diametrically different from the traditional strategic stability. Admittedly, there are still shortfalls in the effectiveness of China’s deterrent capability as a leverage against the US, which helps generate the opportunistic thinking on the part of the United States as to how to suppress and weaken China’s nuclear retaliation capabilities. Implementing damage limitation strategy, developing missile defense capabilities, and launching strategic anti-submarine warfare are the main maneuvers of the US strategic opportunism against China. While China endeavors to maintain its nuclear deterrent capacity and the stability of an asymmetricdeterrence, the United States has been seeking to weaken China’s nuclear retaliation capability and disrupt the asymmetric nuclear stability between the two countries. In order to break the stalemate, China needs to step up efforts to improve the quality of its nuclear weapons, enhance the effectiveness of deterrence signaling, dispel the US strategic opportunistic mentality with reliable nuclear deterrence and counterattack capacities, maintain strategic stability between the two countries, especially crisis stability, and build a firm foundation for containing the outbreak of war."}

It remains a taboo subject in the integration process to introduce supranationalism into high-politics fields, such as defense and security. However, since 2016, supranational elements have been witnessed in the efforts of EU’s defense cooperation arrangements. This change has a considerable bearing on the increasingly grave security situation facing Europe in recent years and the newly formed security concept under this context. The new severe security situation is characterized by not only interwoven traditional and non-traditional threats but also intertwined internal and external security challenges. Meanwhile, the divergence of interests between Europe and its long-standing ally, the United States, has become increasingly salient. These circumstances have generated a strong desire among the EU member states to reinforce defense and security cooperation. The synthesis of supranationalism and intergovernmentalism can be seen in the establishment of European Defense Fund（EDF） as well as the formulation and implementation of initiatives like \"Permanent Structured Cooperation\"（PESCO）, which signifies a major breakthrough in European integration over the past years. In the near future, EU’s defense cooperation will be continually constrained by its decision-making mechanism, lack of fund and its relations with NATO. However, France and Germany, the ‘twin engine’ of European integration, will continue to strengthen defense cooperation within the EU framework in the hope of achieving European strategic autonomy. The European Commission’s \"involvement\" in the security and defense issue as well as the UK’s \"Brexit\" will be conducive to boosting the EU’s defense capacity and enhancing EU’s position in the security structure of Europe."}

Such a relationship is completely different from the relations of the United States with its traditional allies and strategic partners in the Middle East. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study their bilateral relations. The concept of “ambiguous allies” provides us with an integrated analytical framework that not only highlights the constraints of such structural factors as geo-strategy, globalization, realignment of regional powers on the US-Turkey relations, but also underlines the role of strategies and policy choices made by the two governments and their leaders in the transformation of the US-Turkey alliance. Under the influence of both structural and process factors, the US-Turkey alliance is shifting from a traditional alliance to an ambiguous one, which will not only exert a comprehensive and far-reaching impact on the two countries’ regional strategies and regional security order, but also bring new uncertainties to the alliance system of the United States."}

The Belt and Road Initiative, featuring regional cooperation, can effectively mitigate China’s security dilemma. The absence of Northeast Asia from the Belt and Road Initiative is mainly due to tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the negative role played by the US and the Sino-Japan rivalry, all of which can cause a security dilemma in this region. A gradual incorporation of Northeast Asia into the Belt and Road Initiative will, to some extent, ease the security competition in the region, which in turn can provide a new impetus for deepening regional cooperation and thus form a virtuous cycle. Up till now, Russia, Mongolia and South Korea have demonstrated positive gestures toward the Belt and Road Initiative and North Korea has shown some interest. On the contrary, Japan and the US hold complex feelings toward the Initiative. With the endeavor to promote the integration of Northeast Asia into the Initiative, China should start with bilateral ties, encouraging all the regional countries to join in the Initiative and the AIIB and then expand the bilateral ties to China-Japan-ROK, China-Russia-DPRK and China-DPRK-ROK trilateral cooperation.

As a key component of the \"offensive wedge strategy\", \"subordinate-side pressure\" refers to a means of splitting an alliance, employing crises to exert security pressures on the subordinate allies in an alliance and causing tension within it until its disintegration. Through studies on the covariant relationship among the elements of this microscopic alliance theory, the findings are that \"existing power comparison\", \"power changing tendency\" and \"power gain-loss judgment\" among major powers are the three core variables that determine the implementation effect of the \"subordinate-side pressure\" strategy. The willingness of the leading country to intervene in its ally’s crisis tends to be the strongest under the condition of \"strength advantage\" and \"trend anxiety\", while it will be the weakest the other way around. As for the two uncertain situations of \"possessing strength advantage with trend dominance\" and \"suffering strength disadvantage with trend anxiety\", the explanation will be more compelling when applying the \"prospect theory\" to the auxiliary judgment of \"power gain-loss situation\" of the leading country in the alliance. The proposal of this theory of exerting \"subordinate-side pressure\" not only has great significance of practical guidance for the specific implementation conditions, timing, and strategy selection of the existing \"offensive wedge strategy\", but also helps the strategy-implementer avoid the counterproductive result of strengthening the ties among members of a hostile alliance due to the misjudgment of conditions and timing."}

However, the phenomenon of \"more wishes, less actions\" still prevails and persists in the current international security cooperation. With the security concept becoming more and more general, the international community has expressed its willingness and wishes to solve nearly all security issues in a cooperative manner. In reality, many security issues leave no room for cooperation. The proposed concept of \"cooperative security\" is a presupposition based on the nature of issues, threat perception and common interests and the determination of the nature of issues is a prerequisite for security cooperation. If parties involved in security cooperation hold different views on the nature of issues, security cooperation cannot be achieved. Otherwise, security cooperation can be fulfilled. If parties concerned hold identical views on the nature of issues, security cooperation will be affected by two factors — threat perception and common interests. Security cooperation is more likely to materialize if relevant parties feel less threatened and have more common interests in dealing with security threats. Conversely, if relevant parties have a high level of threat awareness among each other and less common interests in handling security threats, it will become difficult or even impossible to cooperate.

The summit of fossil energy in particular, that is, the exhaustiveness of coal, oil and natural gas, constrains sustainable development of China’s fossil energy system, and leads to irreversible dependence on imports. In addition, China’s overdependence on coal energy has led to an insecure structure of energy consumption, which will bring more pressure on China in international climate change negotiations.

It has also been playing a central role in the making of Russia’s foreign policies and the setting of the guidelines for its relations with the CIS countries, and at the critical moment of the Ukraine crisis, it exhibited its strength in safeguarding Russia’s national interests and security.

The process of division and realignment of various political forces is speeding up, while the desposition of power among the president. government and parliament will get some adjustment. The social contradictions will become intenser. Taking advantage of the referendum and adoption of the new federal constitution, the national separationists and local autonomists will ask for more rights from the central government. Strikes, protests and crimes can be. found everywhere with Mafia forces expanding wildly and social tension being diffcult to be relaxed."}

Western countries have imposed large-scale, all-encompassing and highintensity economic sanctions against Russia in various fields, including finance and trade. In response, Russia has taken a number of active countermeasures. The impact of this economic warfare between great powers, triggered by geopolitical conflicts, is extremely far-reaching. If it continues for a long time, it will not only further weaken Russia’s economy but will also threaten the stability of the global market, as well as the recovery process of the global economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, this economic warfare will further undermine the fragile process of economic globalization and the liberal international economic system, highlighting the importance of defending national economic security and thus becoming a powerful force in reshaping the global political and economic order."}

In terms of geo-economics, \"Greater Eurasia\" aims to develop Russia's eastern regions of Siberia and the Far East, as well as to promote regional economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region; in terms of geo-politics, \"Greater Eurasia\" intends to make Russia a powerful country in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the centre of the Eurasian continent; in terms of world order, Russia hopes to build \"Greater Eurasia\" into the birthplace of the new world order and a carrier, as an alternative to the unipolar world. The concept of \"Greater Eurasia\" has already been developed. The concept of \"Greater Eurasia\" has already been launched, and subsequent measures will be introduced one after another.

To this end, Russia has taken a variety of initiatives to support the reconstruction of Syria in the security, political and economic spheres, such as multilateral peacekeeping and assistance in the reconstruction of security mechanisms, promotion of the formation and operation of the Constitutional Council, and the provision of international assistance. These initiatives have a distinctly Russian character, namely, a pragmatic philosophy, a multilateral approach and the use of military force.

Compared with the military doctrine in 1993, this draft has changed in  many ways, which can be reflected in the following aspects: 1) it reiterates that the United States and NATO remain as the biggest threats to Russia; 2) it reemphasizes the development of nuclear deterrent forces and extensive use of nuclear weapons; 3) it lays stress on the tremendous impact of  high technology on future wars; 4) it sets score on space wars and active air defense; 5) it advocates bigger defense spending and the promotion of war industry complex; 6) it stresses the development of conventional armed forces; and 7) it stresses CIS’collective security system and military integration. These changes exhibit Russia’s basic concept for safeguarding national security in the new century and mark the formation of a new military strategy.

Along with the revival of its national power, Russia's international strategic outlook has also undergone important changes. Russia believes that the influence of the United States is declining, the West is losing its dominance of globalisation, and a polycentric international order is emerging. The Russian-Georgian conflict is an important test of Russia's new international strategic outlook. However, the rise of Russia's national power has not improved its external environment, and the Russian-Georgian conflict and the global financial crisis in 2008 have led to the deterioration of Russia's neighbourhood and the international environment. Russia has therefore accelerated the adjustment of its foreign policy, on the one hand, declaring its determination to resolutely safeguard its national interests, endeavouring to maintain its position and influence in the former Soviet Union region, and intensifying its cooperation with the emerging powers, and on the other hand, attempting to build a \"strategic partnership\" on equal terms with the United States by taking advantage of the coming to power of Barack Obama. On the other hand, it tries to take the opportunity of Obama's coming to power to establish a \"strategic partnership\" with the United States on an equal footing, and at the same time continue to strengthen the interdependence between Russia and Europe and build a \"unified space\" between Russia and Europe.

Putin proposed that Russia should be \"integrated\" into Europe, is to clear understanding of the issue, the cohesion of domestic views and strength, to seize the opportunity of the profound changes taking place in Europe, on the basis of \"new common values\", and Europe to build a \"unified political, economic and security space\". A \"unified political, economic and security space\" is being built with Europe on the basis of \"new common values\", so that Russia can get on the \"train\" of the European Union and European integration and realise its aspirations to revitalise the country. However, although Europe, with the European Union at its centre, also proposes to build a \"unified space\" with Russia, it is not prepared to include Russia in the process of European integration they envisage, but merely wants to use it as a means of establishing more stable relations of cooperation and a mechanism for promoting the continuation of the Russian Federation. Instead, they want to use it as a means of establishing more stable relations of cooperation with Russia and a mechanism to promote Russia's continued reforms in the direction of \"democratisation\", as the West would like it to be. This difference in goals will certainly affect the breadth and depth of Russian-European cooperation, and Putin's efforts to \"integrate\" into European diplomacy, although beneficial to Russia, will be a long and winding road with limited success."}

The U.S.-Russian geopolitical rivalry is closely related to the conflict of their mutual perceptions. The U.S. usually regards Russia as a defeated adversary, requiring it to accept the U.S. definition of its international status and \"guidance\" on its internal and external policies, and if it violates them, it is regarded as a centralising tendency or an attempt at empire that needs to be resisted. In order to contain the challenges that this might pose and to push Russia in the direction that the United States wants it to evolve, the United States has continually weakened the capital that Russia relies on for confrontation. In Russia's view, the embrace of the West and strategic compromises have not resulted in the expected recognition of the West and its respect for Russia's security space; instead, the United States has pressed Russia strategically. The policy choices of the United States and Russia under this mutual perception will largely affect the concrete process of the geopolitical competition between the United States and Russia."}

Its principal approaches are as follows: （1）advocating multipolar world and making active play of its special role as an independent pole in the world; （2） further adjusting the policy toward CIR and consolidating its sphere of influences in the region; （3） deepening the relations with the Asia-Pacific countries and establishing its Eurasian big power status. But there are still major difficuties in realizing above targets, mostly due to the weakening of Russia’s millitary superiority and the heavy hardship in revitalizing its economy at the beginning of next centry. As a result, Russia can make few progress in diplomacy.      In the future, Russia will be positioned inferiorly  in the multipolar world. However, in taking advantege of its geo-advantege and current millitary ability, Russia could still play an active and stable role in building a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order, and keeping the regional prosperity and development."}

In the early years of Russia's independence, Boris Yeltsin pursued integration into the West and pursued a development strategy that relied entirely on the West, resulting in a loss of independence and initiative in Russia's national development. After Putin came to power, he put forward a \"strategy of strengthening the country\" in line with Russia's situation, with the goal of revitalising the Russian economy and restoring Russia's status as a world power. From the present point of view, Putin's development ideas are basically consistent with the actual situation in Russia, and has won the support of the general public in the country, and its future prospects are generally favourable. However, the constraints of Russia's internal opposition, as well as the West's dissatisfaction, fear and obstruction, will surely make Putin's road to power full of difficulties and challenges."}

After the Cold War, the Russian threat to EU security is no longer a priority, but it remains an important factor influencing the EU's Common Security Policy (CSP). During the Cold War period, the Western European Common Security Policy was more limited to defence, while after the Cold War, it has shown an expansionary trend. Currently Russia supports the EU's Common Security Policy and efforts to create an independent European defence. The development of the EU's common defence and security depends to a considerable extent on the mutual trust in EU-Russia relations. Since the cooperation between the EU and Russia is based on Russia's weakness and the inability to ignore its role in European security issues, they will be both co-operative and competitive in European security issues, both mutual needs and struggles, compromises and contradictions coexist."}

The current presidential system of government, the maturity of civil society, and the ideological and organisational development of political parties are the three main factors affecting the development of political parties in Russia during the transition period. Russia is at the initial stage of establishing a relatively stable multi-party system; party politics is party politics within the system of \"authoritarian democracy\"; political parties have not become, and cannot become, the main political mediators between the regime and the society; the status and role of political parties in the life of the country during the transition period are limited."}

Along with their frequent high-level contacts they have improved their political relations rapidly, and strengthened their economic exchanges and security cooperation. This is a reflection of big powers’ readjustment of their international strategies and their relations among each other in the post-Cold War era.  By promoting its ties with Japan, Russia intends to counterbalance the influence of NATO’s eastward expansion so as to leave more leeway for itself in the international relations, while it wants to take advantage of Japan’s investment and technology to develop its Far East area so as to restore and reinforce its economic capacity as soon as possible.  As far as Japan is concerned, under the condition that its long-time effort in getting back the Northern Territories from Russia could not have a good effect, it expects to change a way of solving the dispute by giving up the principle that \"economy must be bound up with politics\" and putting forward the three principles of  \"mutual confidence, mutual benefit and long-term point of view\" in the hope of creating conditions for a final solution of the territorial dispute through cemented political and economic cooperation with Russia.  The improvement of Russian-Japanese relations will contribute to the formation of a multi-polar pattern in the Asia-Pacific region.

The frequent changes of the government and the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections have caused direct shock on the country’s economy which has become increasingly the tool of political struggle, and no economic programs and policies could be carried out completely and efficiently in any administration. Russia is confronted with various difficulties such as the lack of incentives for economic growth, the decrease of investment, the decline of people’s living conditions, the reduction of purchasing power, the increase of unemployment and the shrinkage of its foreign trade, etc.. Up to now, Russia hasn’t selected an economic development model which is compatible with its national situation, while the government’s economic regulation is temporary in the main. In face of today’s swift development of the economic globalization, whether Russia can keep its advantageous position in the more and more intensified international competition is decided not only by its domestic economic reform, but also by whether it can join the WTO smoothly as soon as possible and establish an equal trade-partnership with the West. If the intermediate alliance led by Yevgeni Primakov and Yuri Luzhkov can win in the general election, they will not reverse Russia’s reform, and will completely push ahead with the society-oriented market economy and put in central place the revitalization of the national industry. It is estimated that during the early 10 years of the next century Russia’s GDP may be up to 3-5%, and its GDP and overall national strength being expected to rank among the first 10 nations in the world in 2020 or so."}

The capital outflow brings Russia’s economy many bad effects, such  as serious decline  on  the  investment  capital  for  demestic  economic development, bad effects on the balance of international trade and the stability of exchange rate, enlarged risks on debt, etc.   To  conquer these bad effects, the below-listed measures should be taken:  keeping a stable situation  for  politics  and  economy,   further  perfecting management on current account, improving efficiency for controlling on international trade  and  foreign  exchange  rate,   speeding  up  the  reforming  step  of  modern  enterprise  system,   building  a  sound enterprise self-control system,  strengrhening  information  exchanges and international cooperation with other countries  so  as  to  better follow up Russia’s oversea capital,   taking  effective  meassures  to enhance the outflow capital back. Russia’s capital  outflow  shows  us some enlightening Guidances, which are listed below: we should well  treat  the  relationship  among  reform,   development  and  stability,   process sysmatically to push all reform measures to be realized, reform  state-owned enterprises positively and effectively,  and  build  a  vigorous micro-mechanism, enforce the building of legal system  and  completely control the economic activities,positively and safely  push  financial reform and  build a finacial system to  fit  for  the  development  of market economy as soon as possible, and use foreign capital rationally and efficiently"}

Transferring from \"strategic offensive to strategic defensive\", Yeltsin had to abandon his ambition to compete in next presidential election, and made unprecedented concession on a series of issues such as the choose of Prime Minister’s candidate, constitution amendment and Russian Communist Party representative’s serving as the first deputy PM. This, however, does not mean that Yeltsin give up his power. On the contrary, he still holds the power firmly.  What he did was to expand the government’s power in an appropriate degree.  Appointed as PM in times of national crises, Primakov took stability as his priority policy and established a government dominated by left and intermediate forces.  Although he won the support from various major political forces as the PM, he was not accorded the same treatment in his work.  The government is restrained by various political forces and under pressure from western countries, and will experience tests from both the parliament and presidential elections.   Facing so many challenges, the new government can not solve  system problems in less than two years of tenure."}

In view of the complex relations between Russia, the European Union, NATO and the United States, the development of Russo-European relations could further promote the institutionalisation of Russian-North American cooperation and reduce the role of NATO as an instrument of American global strategy.

The contradictions in the center of the upper powers have come to surface.  The main social contradictions have shifted from the strife between the authority and the opposition to internal one among the ruling groups.  Economically,although the economy has been  picking up,its accumulated problems remain unsolved.  Yeltsin has two purposes to achieve in changing the government: one is to solidify the president’s centralized status, to reduce the financial group’s influence on the government and to make early preparations for next presidential election; the other is to completely solve the economic problems that the Chernomyrdin administration could not afford to cope with so as to ensure the economic growth.  Therefore, Yeltsin required the new government to implement the \"twelve major affairs\" the former government had set based on social harmony and stability while pursuing administrative reforms to reduce the staff and raise the efficiency of the administration,  straightening out the relations between the central and local governments, enhancing state’s macro-control, ensuring the stability of the national finance, promoting productive investment and strengthening social security. But the new government faces many challenges and difficulties which may make the government’s tough economic policy unworkable, such as the possibility for the congress and financial magnates to make trouble, the government’s daily work being likely to be interfered by early preparation for next election and so many economic difficulties and social problems lingering ahead."}

The U.S. treats each of the four countries in different approaches. At present, since the U.S. has completed its basic strategic readjustments towards the first three categories, “the Transforming Nations” are likely to become the top priority of the U.S. global strategy in the future. “The Transforming Nations” mainly refers to the three major powers like Russia, China and India. They are evolving at the direction of political democratization and economic liberalization, though prospect still not clear. In the American points of view, there not only exists great “uncertainty” in the development of the three countries, but the three countries have the “potentials” to unite into an anti-American strategic alliance, which will constitute a major “potential threat”. Therefore, the U.S. is ready to take two layers of strategies in response to this situation,  Firstly, to carry out a policy of “Constructive Engagement”, to lead those countries to a direction in favor of the United States; Secondly, to implement a strategy of  “divide and rule” or checking neighbors against one another, in order to prevent them from organizing alliance. Among these three countries, what the U.S. worries the most is China, which is not only left still a Communist country, but also a power rising rapidly. In the future, it is probable that the U.S. reinforce its relationships with Russia and India to check and balance against China. China should seek strategic balance of power among the U.S., Russia, and India."}

With the support of the Western countries, Ukraine’s fighting capability will increase, and neither Russia nor Ukraine will reconcile easily.

The UK has made major adjustments to its policies toward Central Asia. The new policies have regained their value orientation and enhanced the consensus between the UK and Central Asian countries; they have strengthened cooperation with Central Asian countries with development aid as the center; and they have promoted the decoupling of Central Asian countries from Russia and weakened Russia’s regional influence.

His attempt at strengthening the central authority can not be blamed as personal usurpation of dictatorial power because it satisfies the needs for political stability and economic progress. That explains its support from the Russian people in general. Instead, political power building should be further deepened in the country.  In fact, Russia’s economic recovery awaits straightening out the central  local relationship. President Putin is actually exploring a model for speeding up economic expansion by giving full play to freedom in the economic arena, while retaining state macro control at the indispensable minimum.  He will most probably not copy mechanically the free market economy model, thus steering clear of the same old disastrous course taken by his predecessor. His relationship with the political opposition, the Communist Party in particular, consists of struggling, cooperation and utilization with possible expansion of shared views.  This will find its manifestation in the selection of a development path geared to Russia’s national conditions through mutual restraints. The young Russian top leader elevates his multi  dimensional foreign policy to the theoretical level of seeking equilibrium, a matter determined by Russia’s state interests in the new transition period, albeit with emphasis in its implementation. Western media accusations of President Putin in pulling Russia back to the former Soviet Union fly in the face of realities. The Russian President Putin is trying to integrate the three major ideological trends of liberalism, socialism and nationalism in his country. This has invited Western resentment."}

The interaction between leaders has increased significantly. EU member states have actively participated in Central Asian affairs. The EU’s Central Asia policy has become more political and independent. It shows a development trend of dual commitment, which is conducive to enhancing policy effects, but the EU’s proactive actions complicate regional competition and cooperation and stimulate the competitive awareness of Russia and other countries. The EU’s strategic autonomy will also affect the coordination between the United States and Europe.

The Ukraine crisis has prompted a change in the judgment of NATO countries, including Canada, on the security situation in the Arctic and the security threat posed by Russia in it. The United States has elevated Arctic security to an unprecedented strategic level and asked NATO allies to act in concert with its actions.

Especially the United States demands, in disregard of the strong protest from Russia and the international community, revision of the anti  ballistic missile treaty and put forward to develop and deploy the NMD and TMD systems, which seriously damaged the world strategic detente established in mid 1990s.

In view of the fact that the political situation was not stable in           Russia, its economic prospect is hard to turn for the better in a short time, it is difficult to           contain the momentum of economic separatism in one or two years’ time.

Influenced by the US diplomacy, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the German-French differences and other factors, the EU will make efforts to adjust and shape its co-operative relationship with NATO through calibrating the strategic positioning of NATO, coping with the limited shock of the US-EU relationship, and maintaining the multiple diplomatic relations, etc., and in the process, establish and maintain the strategic autonomy of the EU."}

The interaction between the United States, Russia, Europe and China is more prominent and their relations more complex, with the European Union in a unique position. As a consortium of small and medium-sized countries, the EU has an unprecedented sense of crisis and urgency, fearing that it will not be able to effectively safeguard its own interests, and even become a venue for the big powers to compete, and therefore has begun to adjust its great power diplomacy and global policy, including strengthening the construction of strategic autonomy, increasing the bargaining chips for dialogue with the big powers; trying to maintain its relative independence, and playing the role of a coordinator and balancer in the relations between the big powers; and menuising and thematising its co-operation with the big powers; and striving to safeguard its economic, political and military power. We should try to maintain relative independence and play the role of coordinator and balancer in the relations among the big powers, menuise cooperation with the big powers and make it more topical, and strive to maintain the overall stability of the relations among the big powers and the international multilateral mechanism. The maintenance and reform of the world order depend on good relations among the major powers. China is actively participating in the reform and construction of the global governance system and needs partners and co-operators. China and Europe have more commonalities than differences in the concepts of win-win situation and interdependence of the world, as well as in the opposition to power politics and the maintenance of multilateral order. There is much room for cooperation between China and Europe in promoting positive interaction among the four major forces of the United States, Russia, Europe and China, restraining hegemony and unilateralism, and safeguarding multilateralism in the international order."}

In the midst of accelerating changes unseen in a century and escalating competitions among major countries, key middle countries are actively and flexibly engaging in multi-alignment diplomacy. Although key middle countries have strengthened military ties with the United States, they generally refuse to join the military camp of the United States to contain China and Russia. Their economic relations with the United States have improved. At the same time, they have not fundamentally changed the pace of economic cooperation with China and Russia. They enjoy closer strategic ties with the United States, and they have made even greater progress in strategic cooperation with China and Russia to lead the common development of the Global South. The decisive reasons why key middle countries implement multi-alignment diplomacy are their disappointment to the United States and the Western countries, their desire for cooperation with China and Russia and their confidence in the multi-polarization of the international order. The multialignment diplomacy of key middle countries has led to a rise of the new non-alignment movement in the Global South, providing China and Russia ample room to maneuver in the face of the strategic containment of the United States. The intensity and destructive degree of competitions among major countries have also been greatly weakened, making multipolarization easier to realize in the world.

Why does this move not substantially accelerate the process of de-dollarization of the world, especially the US dollar reserves in the global international currency reserves rather than decline in status? From the perspective of international security, countries and actors that feel insecure because of US financial sanctions have different currency choices from those that feel safer because of US financial sanctions. On the one hand, US financial sanctions strengthen the security of the sanctioning coalition, reinforcing the security of countries that do not implement the sanctions but largely agree with their targets. Despite the increased economic costs of the US, these countries are willing to accept the “safety premium” of the US dollar for geopolitical reasons. On the other hand, the aggressive use of financial sanctions by the United States makes more countries fear that their behavior will be sanctioned, thus increasing the motivation of de-dollarization, which may weaken the hegemony of the dollar. In the short term, geopolitical logic has replaced international economic logic as the main driving force for the change in the status of the US dollar’s global foreign exchange reserves, which is positive for the US dollar and makes it more attractive as a foreign exchange reserve. However, de-dollarization has not yet formed economies of scale, and its impact on the status of the dollar is insufficient. In the long run, as economic and security constraints change, the choices of countries that accept the international role of the dollar and those that seek to de-dollarize may also change. The author discusses four possible scenarios: the dominance of the dollar is not threatened, the international monetary system has become camp-oriented, the international monetary system is fragmented, and the dominance of the dollar falls."}

This phenomenon is not only the result of contested multilateralism influenced by major powers, but also a regional cooperation model accepted by the Central Asian states. Through international institutional competition among great powers, Central Asian states can attain more autonomy and better implement their multi-directional and balanced foreign policies. This trend of institutional competition is evident in various ways: both the United States and Russia are committed to improving the level of “C5+1” regime to maintain regional equilibrium. The EU is strengthening its cooperation with Central Asia to seize more opportunities. Regional powers are developing cooperation frameworks with Central Asia to maximize their benefits. China is expanding its cooperation with Central Asia to establish a comprehensive cooperation system. The competition among cooperation models in Central Asia is primarily influenced by three factors: changes in the regional security environment, shifts in great power relations, and alterations in the foreign policies of Central Asian states.

However, this subjective strategic design has brought an imbalance in the United States’ global strategy, leading to the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis and Gaza conflict. The United States had to withdraw some strategic and diplomatic resources to Europe and the Middle East. As a result, America’s national security strategy has achieved a global rebalance, which not only reflects the balance mechanism of power flow and strategic resource allocation among major countries, but also demonstrates strategic consequences of the US’s adherence to relative benefit thinking. Due to the limited strategic and diplomatic resources, the United States will find it difficult to balance the three regions of Europe, the Middle East, and the “Indo–Pacific.” The Ukraine crisis and Gaza conflict are facing the risk of escalation, and the US national security strategy is at a crossroads, with the historical peak of its pivot to Asia-Pacific possibly already over."}

The international community has called for the development of cyberweapons to be restrained by a treaty, but there are many obstacles and difficulties to be overcome, including the lack of consensus on the definition of the concepts of cyberweapons and cyberattacks, the inability of the existing international law to determine whether cyberwarfare is an \"armed conflict\", the conflicting strategic interests of various countries in the development of cyberweapons, and the bottlenecks in the verification of cyberarmaments technology, and so on. This paper argues that the establishment of national norms of cyber behaviour and the adoption of transparency and confidence-building measures are the basis for the conclusion of a cyber arms control treaty; changes in the status quo of international Internet governance will help to reduce the intensity of the cyber arms race and contribute to the conclusion of the treaty; and the treaty on cyber arms control will also require necessary amendments to the existing Law of Armed Conflict to adapt it to the reality of cyber warfare that has already emerged."}

The rise of the Middle Corridor program results from the combined effect of multiple factors. Changes in the world and Eurasian situations have brought important opportunities; Central Asian countries have been constantly making efforts in practice; and European and American countries have increased strategic investment. At the same time, China and the countries along the route have promoted the deep docking of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Middle Corridor, strengthening the strategic value of the Middle Corridor.

However, there is a mismatch and contradiction between the strategic supply of the United States and the strategic demand of Africa, and it is difficult for the Biden administration to improve Africa’s food security in the long run.

At the same time, under the impact of the COVID-19, some radical and political emission reduction measures in the lowcarbon transition process have also exacerbated an international energy short-term supply-demand imbalance which has resulted in soaring energy prices and electricity shortages in many countries. The ongoing global energy shortage underlines the complexity of the international energy transition, and foreshadows that the low-carbon transition process will face many energy security problems.

It has significantly changed the EU’s economic development and operating logic, and brought more serious long-term impacts on the EU than the previous debt crisis; interrupted the EU’s strategic autonomy process; brought new momentum to integration. At the same time, it has increased the negative factors hindering integration within the EU. The Ukraine crisis will further weaken the EU’s strength and international influence, accelerate the EU’s marginalization in the world’s geopolitical structure, and may also kill its geopolitical dream of becoming a world pole. This is not conducive to the multi-polarization of the world, and the containment of hegemonism and power politics. All this is not inevitable. If the lessons of the Ukrainian crisis can be correctly reflected on, and the EU can unite and view the world with a more open and inclusive attitude, the EU may also have a better future."}

Firstly, at the international political level, the Middle East has evolved from a place where the great Powers must fight to a trap against which the great Powers are on high alert.

The five countries have certain developing potentials: abundant natural resources and better social and economic infrastructure. At the same time, they face some difficulties: simple economic struture, lack of capital funds, relative low level of living standard and short of necessary facilities for opening to the outside world. Although the social and political situation in most of the five countries is calm at present, there still exist some unstable factors: complicated national problems, unsettled territorial disputes, increasingly active religious influence and serious problems of growing population. At present the forces of ex-communists in middle Asia are still strong, but they are facing cliallengcs from the other two political forces. One is \"the Democratic Force\" and the other is the Islamic Fundamentalist Force. The influence of Islamism in this region is very likely to become a bigger ideological and political factor affecting its future development.

However, unlike when Trump won the election for the first time in 2016, there have been some disturbing development trends in US–Europe relations. The imbalance in relations between the US and Europe has become even more pronounced. Whether in important fields such as the economy, finance, science and technology, or the military, the gap between the European Union and the United States is widening. Meanwhile, Europe’s dependence on the United States is also increasing. Especially since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, it has formed an all-round dependence on the United States in terms of security, energy, markets, as well as capital and technology. The increasing imbalance in US–Europe relations has triggered anxiety in Europe, including concerns that Europe might become a “vassal” of the United States. During Trump’s second term, Europe may be more inclined to cater to the United States and submit to its demands more often. However, under internal and external pressures, it may also accelerate the process of promoting strategic autonomy. Where the European Union will go will largely depend on the direction and intensity of policy adjustments during Trump’s second term."}

As Mongolia needs to accumulate capital by exploiting its natural resources, which requires a large amount of capital and a long-term process of exploration and development, as well as large-scale infrastructure construction, it has adopted preferential policies to attract foreign capital on the premise of guaranteeing national interests and security. Economic and trade cooperation between Mongolia and China is developing steadily on the basis of the principle of equality and mutual benefit. China is the largest direct investor in Mongolia. Cooperation between Mongolia and China in the development of Mongolia's mineral resources will become the main theme of Mongolia-China economic and trade cooperation in the 21st century. Another very important component of economic cooperation between Mongolia and China today is the protection of the natural environment. In addition to the co-operation between Mongolia and China in the development of pastoralism, China can also invest in or establish joint ventures with Mongolia and China in the processing of meat, dairy and other livestock products. Mongolia and China also have broad prospects for co-operation in the field of plantation.

Following the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and the United States, relations between the two countries have developed rapidly and economic cooperation has been strengthened. In recent years, economic cooperation between Mongolia and Japan has been developing rapidly. Japan is the largest provider of assistance and loans to Mongolia among all aid donors."}

In the comparatively stable situation of the Asia-Pacific region, however, some unstable factors still exist. Under such circumstances, various countries in the region are in a hurry to readjust their security strategies. In adapting themselves to the changes of Asia -Pacific security situation, countries in the region are deliberating successively to put forward various conceptions of security mechanism: The US advocates to hold\"multilateral consultations\"over Asia-Pacific security issues on the basis of maintaining bilateral alliance; Japan proposes to establish a CSCE-patterned Asia-Pacific security institute in the future; Russia holds to have a multilateral negotiation mechanism of the Northeast Asian area as the first step towards that of the Asia-Pacific region; the ASEAN countries stand for taking enlarged ASEAN foreign ministers’ conference as the framework of security mechanism of this region. Both the US and Japan now agree the issue of setting up an Asia 鈥?Pacific security mechanism should be discussed in the coming enlarged ASEAN foreign ministers’ conference. And some other Asian nations advance their respective ideas over the issue as well. Thus, the principles, contents and forms of the Asia-Pacific security cooperation are to be seriously approached by us."}

Russia-Japan strategic conflicts are relatively reduced and more cooperative proposals have been aired due to great changes in Asia-Pacific situation. However,the future Russia-Japan relations will be influenced by a series of factors including the U. S. and the U.

The U. S. leads the world’s new military revolution,and the military capability gap between the U. S. and Russia is widening,thus creating a serious imbalance of strategic power. The imbalance of power and discrepancies in strategic goals give rise to their mistrust in security and strategic matters. The two countries also have huge differences in international strategy and the view of historical development. Therefore,suffering an increasing\"cool- down\",the\"restart\"of their relations can hardly maintain. Meanwhile,from the perspective of geopolitics,the two countries have fiercely competed with each other in the Post- Soviet area and the Middle East,while their serious contradictions on Russia’s domestic politics and human rights issues are obvious. However,due to the complexity of the global agenda and the support they need from each other,no serious conflicts will erupt between the U. S. and Russia,and a particular status of \"cold peace\"plus \"cold cooperation\"can be expected."}

There are two most striking problems: a) abundant international risk capital which has rigged the financial market and disturbed the financial order could not be regulated under the current system; b) currency exchange rates influenced by speculation are skyrocketing one moment and plunge the next. The foreign exchange market turns from normal floating to abnormal spasm casting a great impact on manufacture, trade and finance and constituting the  danger of economic circles of rise and fall worldwide. Under the circumstance, reform of the outmoded world financial system must be put on the agenda. One of the central points of the reform strategy is how to appropriately deal with the relationship between government and market in transnational capital movement. On the other side of the shield, developed countries take advantage of their financial capacity and focus their interest on expanding capital-flow space. The conflicts over rules and procedures incurred from vying for interest and the leading financial role among these countries have actually got the reform nowhere. What’s more, the thoughts and interests of the developing countries could not be fully represented. Therefore, it will be very hard to work out a proposal that could be accepted by both the South and the North and the readjustment of the world financial system will last for a considerably long time."}

What kind of changes will China's development and rise cause in the international pattern and system? In a changing world, especially when China's development itself constitutes an important part of the international situation, and when the \"China threat theory\" and \"China responsibility theory\" are constantly on the rise in the international arena, what kind of new tasks does China face, what kind of national strategy does it need to set up, and what kind of new strategic choices does it need to make? Should it be prepared for danger in times of peace and continue to bide its time and keep its head in the sand? These questions are not only seriously considered by the elites, but are also of great concern to the general public. In view of this, the Modern International Relations magazine held a seminar on 31 August 2008 under the title of \"China's Relationship with the World in the Post-Olympic Era\", inviting more than 20 experts and scholars in related fields from Beijing and Tianjin to have an in-depth discussion on the above issues. The main views of the seminar are summarised below for the benefit of the readers."}

For a long time, the energy industry has been an important pillar of the national economy of the USSR, playing an important role in strengthening the economic and military power of the USSR, developing international trade and earning foreign exchange. Therefore, the successive leaders of the Soviet Union have attached great importance to the development of the energy industry, according to the conditions and changes in the situation, in different periods of time to formulate different energy development strategies and specific policies. Generally speaking, before the mid-1970s, the development of the energy industry in the USSR was relatively smooth, harmonious and balanced. However, in the past decade, especially after the 1980s, energy production has been experiencing a difficult situation in which the original favourable conditions have been lost and various unfavourable factors have increased significantly. In order to solve the increasingly urgent energy problems, the Basic Guidelines for the Long-Term Energy Programme of the USSR were formulated in March 1984, which provided a comprehensive plan for the energy development in the next 20 years. This article provides a preliminary analysis of the current situation and prospects for the development of the energy industry in the USSR."}

The economic take-off of the Asia-Pacific region, with a population of 3.3 billion, has caused concern and reflection in the Soviet Union, and its economy has been on the upswing since the post-war period: during the 20-year period 1960-1980, the economic growth rate in Europe was 4.5 per cent, while in Asia and the Pacific, it was 8 per cent, and at the beginning of the 1980s the average annual growth rate of the world economy was only 1.4 per cent, while the average annual growth rate in Asia and the Pacific remained at 4 per cent. In the early 1980s, the world economy grew at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent, while Asia and the Pacific maintained an average annual growth rate of 4 per cent, and in 1989, Asia and the Pacific grew at an average annual rate of 6.1 per cent after adjusting for inflation, while the European Community and the United States grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively. This shows that Asia and the Pacific is the most dynamic region in the world today in terms of economic development. The Asia-Pacific region's foreign trade development and financial activity; in 1980, the Asia-Pacific trade accounted for 32.9 per cent of the total world trade, and in the 1990s it will account for half of the total world trade. The trade volume of the United States with Asia and the Pacific increased from $120 billion in 1980 to $271 billion in 1988, far exceeding the $186 billion to Western Europe. United States companies have invested more than $33 billion in Asia and the Pacific. Japan relies on the Asia-Pacific market for 55 per cent of its exports and 58 per cent of its imports. The \"Four Little Ones\" of Asia, ASEAN and China have also made the Asia-Pacific region their major trading partner."}
