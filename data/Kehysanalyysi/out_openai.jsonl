It also proposes political-security steps such as implementing “dual suspension” and “dual-track” approaches and leveraging major-power cooperation (China-Russia and China-US). These are clear government- and policy-level solutions, and they assign responsibility/causation to state actions and factors (e.g., US “cold war thinking” and measures, Japan’s actions to stimulate tensions, and the Korean Peninsula confrontation).\n\nThe text repeatedly frames the issue as involving multiple disagreeing sides (DPRK vs US-ROK; China-Japan rivalry; US alliances with Japan/ROK) and as affecting vital national interests (Northeast Asia is “extremely important” to China’s security interests; US concerns about being excluded; Japan’s perceived strategic challenge). It emphasizes economic stakes and consequences: deepening regional cooperation expands trade and serves countries’ economic interests; instability reduces investment interest; and countries are motivated by economic “attractiveness,” third-party market cooperation, and shared benefits, with language about cooperation producing a “virtuous cycle.” It also references peace mediation/arms-control-type measures through discussion of reducing tensions, restarting Six-Party Talks, and transforming the armistice into a peace mechanism, while climate change and poverty/education are not central topics.", "error": null, "cnki_id": "GGXB201802007"}
